            <h1>The Seven Old Samurai</h1>
        
            <p>Once upon a time, in far off <span class="places">Japan</span>, a band of fierce <span class="people">robbers</span> had their 
                hiding place on top of a <span class="places">mountain</span> almost always covered with grey clouds, 
                windswept and battered by storms. The <span class="people">robbers</span> lived in a large <span class="places">cave</span> where they
                had piled their spoils. Now and again, they went down the <span class="places">mountain</span>, attacked a
                <span class="places">village</span>, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could 
                lay hands on and burned it to the ground. Wherever the <span class="people">robbers</span> passed, there 
                was nothing but smoking ruins, weeping <span class="people">men</span> and <span class="people">women</span>, misery, mourning and 
                desolation.</p>

            <p>The <span class="people">Emperor</span>, worried at this, had sent his <span class="people">soldiers</span> to attack the <span class="places">mountain</span>,
                but the <span class="people">robbers</span> had always managed to drive them off. The <span class="people">Emperor</span> sent for one
                of the last remaining <span class="people">Samurai</span>, old <span class="people">Raiko</span>, and said to him:</p>

            <p>"<span class="people">Raiko</span>, you've served me for many years. Do my bidding for one last time. 
                Go to the <span class="places">mountain</span> at the head of an army and wipe out these bloodthirsty 
                <span class="people">bandits</span>." <span class="people">Raiko</span> sighed.</p>

            <p>"<span class="people">Your Majesty</span>, if I were young again I'd do it alone. Today I'm too old, 
                far too old to do that, or to command an army."</p>

            <p>"Must I then," said the <span class="people">Emperor</span>, "submit to the force of these marauding 
                robbers?" The old <span class="people">Samurai</span> replied:</p>

            <p>"No, I'll go up there with six <span class="people">Samurai</span> like myself."</p>

            <p>"But if they're all as old as you, how can they help you?"</p>
            
            <p>"Have faith in us!" said <span class="people">Raiko</span>.</p>
            
            <p>A few days later, the seven <span class="people">Samurai</span> set off on their journey, not with 
            horses, swords, shields and armour, which they could no longer have worn 
            anyway, but dressed as humble <span class="people">pilgrims</span>. From the <span class="places">summit</span>, the <span class="people">bandits</span> watched 
            them come, and their <span class="people">leader</span> said,</p>
            
            <p>"Who cares about seven <span class="people">beggars</span>. Let them climb up." The seven reached the 
            <span class="places">cave</span> and <span class="people">Raiko</span> humbly said,</p>
            
            <p>"Let us come in, it's cold <span class="places">outside</span>. There's a wind blowing and we, as you 
            can see, are <span class="people">old</span>. We'll be no trouble to you." The leader of the gang 
            scornfully replied:</p>
            
            <p>"Come in, old <span class="people">men</span>, and stay in a <span class="places">corner</span>." And so. the seven <span class="people">pilgrims</span> 
            huddled in a <span class="places">corner</span> while the <span class="people">bandits</span> ate their meal of food stolen from the 
            <span class="places">villages</span> nearby.</p>

            <p>Now and again, they threw scraps of food and leftovers to the old <span class="people">men</span>, 
            saying: "Eat this, and it is much too good for you." A few hours later, <span class="people">Raiko</span> 
            rose to his feet saying:</p>
            
            <p>"The wind has dropped. We can go on our way. In thanks. for your 
            hospitality, we would like to offer you this special drink. 
            Drink our health with it." The <span class="people">robbers</span> needed no second telling. In the blink 
            of an eye, they had emptied the goatskin bottle <span class="people">Raiko</span> held out to them. And in
            the blink of an eye they all lay dead, for the drink contained a very potent 
            poison. And so, the seven <span class="people">Samurai</span>, too old to wield a sword, served the 
            <span class="people">Emperor</span> for the last time.</p>
